# Define the question
## to determine the groupnof individuals whoa re most likely to click on ads
---
#the metric for success
#### the succes will be determined by  ability to identify which group  mostly clicked on ads
---
#the context
#### A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.

#experimental design taken
### 1.the process involves , installing necesssary packages
###2.loading dataset to R
###3.Performing data cleaning and outlier detection
###4. doing univariate and Bivariate abalysis
---

# loading  our data data set

```{R}
#install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")
```
## loading data 
```{r}
df<- read_excel("C:/Users/hp/Downloads/advertising.xls")
df
```
# to  view dataset
```{R} 
head(df)
```

# to check for shape of our data
```{r}
dim(df)
# there are 1000 rows and 10 columns in our dataset
```
# checking for data types for our ariables
```{R}
str(df)

```
# checking for missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
# there no null values in our data set
#
```
# to check for duplicates
```{r}
#Check for duplicates
duplicated_rows <- df[duplicated(df),]

duplicated_rows
# there are no duplicates

```
### checking for outliers in numeric columns
 
```{R}
boxplot(df$Age) # outlier detection in age variable
# there are no outliers in age
```
```{R}
boxplot(df$'Area Income')
```
```{R}
boxplot(df$'Daily Internet Usage')

```
#
## clicked on Ad vs Male
```{R}
cor(df$Male, df$'Clicked on Ad')
# there is a weak negative correlation between gender and  clicked on Ad
```
#
#clicked on Ad vs Daily_Internet_Usage
```{R}
cor(df$'Daily Internet Usage', df$'Clicked on Ad')
# there is a strong negative correlation between Daily_Internet_Usage and Clicked on Ad
# there is a  negative correlatio between cluicked on AD and  daily internet usage
```
## clicked on Ad vs Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site
```{R}
cor(df$'Daily Time Spent on Site', df$'Clicked on Ad')
# a strong negative correlation is witnessed between clicked on Ad and Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site
```
#### Covariance
#covarriance between Age and  Clicked on Ad
```{R}
cov(df$Age, df$'Clicked on Ad')
# there exist a positive covvariance  between  age variable and our target variable of 2.164
```

# clicked on Ad vs Male
```{R}
cov(df$Male, df$'Clicked on Ad')
# there is  negative  covvariance  between gender and  our target variable  of -0.009
```
#clicked on Ad vs Daily_Internet_Usage
```{R}
cov(df$'Daily Internet Usage', df$'Clicked on Ad')
# a strong negative covariance is witnessed between the two variables of -17.27
```
#
#clicked on Ad vs Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site
```{R}
cov(df$'Daily Time Spent on Site', df$'Clicked on Ad')
# there is a negative covariance bewtween target variable and Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site of -5.933
```

#CONCLUSION and recomendation
### a strong negative covariance is witnessed between the two variables of -17.27
#there is a negative covariance bewtween target variable and Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site of -5.933
## moast respondents are between 30 to 40 years of age
# more  target  should be made on  the age pract of 30 to 40
